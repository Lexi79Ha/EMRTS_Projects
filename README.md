<h1>Traveling Politican Solution</h1>
<h4> This program was created to solve the Traveling Politician Problem, which requires someone to find the shortest possible route for a the policitian's campaign trail starting in Iowa, visiting every state capital, and ending in DC.
<h2> What does the program do?</h2
<h4> 1. Imports a CVS file that contains all the capital cities of the US and their longitudes and latitudes<br>2. Create Scatter plot,group State Capitals into small clusters, and label clusters with numbers<br>
  4. Uses itertool to find permutations for every possible route<br>5. Uses geopy to calculate distance between each coordinate<br>5. Identifies the route with the shortest distance<br>6. Repeats process through each clusters<br>7. Add total distance together and outputs the entire route that will be traveled </h4>
<h2>What to Import?</h2>
<h4>- import matplotlib.pyplot as plt<br>
- import sklearn<br>
- import folium<br>
- import itertools<br>
- import geopy<br>
- import unittest</h4>
